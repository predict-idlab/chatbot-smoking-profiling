The gravestones stood silently, row upon row like soldiers long forgotten, a scream shattered the silence...
It was there and then it had gone, why would a rabbit be on my bathroom floor? 
Bleary-eyed, I went downstairs for breakfast, the house was empty, even the furniture had gone...
The lights flickered and then went off, then the sirens started, it was coming, we knew it wouldn’t be the last time...

Dad just sat and cried.  He cried for three whole days.  His face was blotchy and his eyes were red. Then one day he just stopped...
The clock stopped... 74 minutes past 18...it was time to get up.
The car screamed to a halt, four men wearing masks jumped out and ran into the nearest building, I looked around. The street was deserted except for me. 
Everything stopped, people were stood like statues all around me, people in cars, men on bicycles, babies in prams all lifeless, frozen in time. 
I had never seen a ghost.  But like they say, there is a first time for everything.

"Witches don't exist!" My gran's words echoed around my head as the horrific visage gurned at me through my bedroom window.
Keeping watch at the side of the ship, George was tiring; his eyes weary from constantly searching the horizon, were they also playing tricks on him?  What was that waving from the rocks? 
The two coins in his pocket clinked together as he stumbled down the cold pavement, the holes in his shoes turning his feet into blocks of ice.  His heart was warmed though in the knowledge that he was rich.
